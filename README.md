# Hello world

I am Bogdan Protsenko, a self taught front end developer/problem solver working out of London. So far I have a melting pot of work experience operating as a freelancer, working in small dev shops and a 4 year stint in [Grabyo](https://about.grabyo.com/us/) where I helped bring about core platform features. I am currently with [Arithmix](https://www.arithmix.com/) where I am helping them keep their UI lean, mean and running smoothly. Interested in working with me? Check out [my website](https://notbogdan.github.io) for a little bit of my work, and don't hesitate to get in touch.
